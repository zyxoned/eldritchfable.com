# Eldritch Fable shared workspace handoff

Current task: discovery-first design revision, October 30, 2026 (America/New_York).
Executor: connected GitHub and SentinelX staging tools. This is a design handoff,
not a claim of implemented or deployed expedition behavior.

## Owner direction and public/private boundary

The owner accepted illustrated top-down 2D and the supplied candlelit
black/antique-gold "Adventures Become Real" visual target. They now require
**ruined Mossvale as a freely playable starting area**, optional hooks, decisions
that affect direction, and a first-time experience without plot spoilers.

The earlier arrival route ballot, full destination cards and automatic group
teleportation are superseded. The [revised design](../superpowers/specs/2026-10-30-eldritch-expeditions-design.md)
uses physical discovery and affirmative individual travel. Social parties may
split between runs; members of one run may occupy different accessible floors.
Each hero has one authoritative active assignment and location.

Concealed narrative canon is intentionally outside the public repository.
Its authorized staging-host record is indexed by the per-worktree metadata path
returned by `git rev-parse --git-path eldritch-private-canon.json`.
Read that local index through existing authorized host access when writing final
story content. Do not copy its contents into public docs, bundles, asset names,
fixtures, screenshots or PR descriptions. Exact private paths stay in metadata.

## Source and workspace observations

Application main: `4c54082e55279d1f0efa301a5fd40e198405b8d9`.
Task branch: `docs/mmo-readiness-20261029`, upstream of the same name.
Application/documentation commit before this update:
`8e967b2ac26f43f33c47947e8f57ec93c0be7832`.

Before editing/publication the isolated task worktree was clean, with no active
Git operation, staged/unstaged/untracked changes or unpublished task work.
Fresh helper inspection/sync found upstream 0/0 and main ahead/behind 3/0.
Original development and recovery branches are preserved. This session acquired
its own lease; release only the owning session's token after publication.

The cloud environment was pending/offline when checked. Connected staging/source
tools suffice for this design work; its inaccessible files are not certified.
The public draft remains PR #9. Publish only reviewed player-safe documentation
against the expected branch head, then fetch/fast-forward the clean task checkout
and verify exact file contents and the remote SHA.

## Scope and validation

Intended public files: PROJECT_STATE.md, this handoff, MMO_SKILL_READINESS.md and
docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-30-eldritch-expeditions-design.md.
The private canon record/index is deliberately not a Git source change.
No runtime, installed skill/dependency, service, database or production change is
part of this revision.

Independent narrative/agency, source/authority and builder reviews checked the
proposal. Verify relative links, whitespace, intended-file scope and exclusion
of concealed canon before publication. Application tests were not rerun for
documentation-only changes. Earlier exact-main CI passed build/server syntax,
69 backend and 30 browser tests; see the [earlier handoff](https://github.com/zyxoned/eldritchfable.com/blob/8e967b2ac26f43f33c47947e8f57ec93c0be7832/docs/workspace/HANDOFF.md)
for dated evidence. No new CI or live-flow result is implied.

## Watcher operation retained

The existing development Relay watcher was previously verified as a system-managed,
enabled service checking the enrolled development checkout about every 300 seconds.
It was not restarted or freshly service-audited during this story revision.
It does not deploy, push, merge main, run tests or resolve semantic conflicts.
An editing lease pauses its synchronization; inspect current metadata/journal
and result timestamps rather than treating a running PID as a fresh fetch.

Resolve the designated development unit from private host metadata. These are
operator controls with a placeholder, not commands executed during this task:

```sh
sudo systemctl status --no-pager <development-relay-unit>
sudo journalctl --unit <development-relay-unit> --lines 10 --no-pager
sudo systemctl stop <development-relay-unit>
sudo systemctl disable --now <development-relay-unit>
sudo systemctl enable --now <development-relay-unit>
```

The immutable earlier handoff preserves activation/recovery details. No production
checkout is enrolled for automatic development repair.

## Next action and remaining decisions

Continue the owner's story discussion about the final-victory consequence using
the private canon. Do not reveal concealed identities or explanatory lore just
to fill an unspecified ending. The current public design leaves that author
decision open; temple length, anchor spacing and reward/recovery details also
remain proposals.

After the revised written design is approved, invoke Superpowers writing-plans.
Do not ask the owner to select 2D versus 3D or accept an upfront route menu again.
Deployment remains a separate operation under the existing repository rules;
production was not rechecked or changed in this phase.
